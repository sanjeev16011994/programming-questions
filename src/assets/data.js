  "question": "Explain the concept of React Portals and their use cases.",
  "answer": "React Portals allow components to render content outside of their parent DOM hierarchy. They provide a way to render children into a DOM node that exists outside the DOM hierarchy of the parent component. Portals are useful for scenarios like modals, tooltips, or any content that needs to break out of the parent's styling or positioning constraints while maintaining the React component structure."
},
{
  "id": 78,
  "question": "What is the purpose of the 'useCallback' hook in React?",
  "answer": "The 'useCallback' hook in React is used to memoize functions, preventing them from being recreated on every render. It is particularly useful when passing functions as props to child components to optimize performance. By memoizing the function, you ensure that it only changes when its dependencies change, preventing unnecessary re-renders of components that receive the function as a prop."
},
{
  "id": 79,
  "question": "Explain the concept of code splitting in React applications.",
  "answer": "Code splitting in React involves breaking down the JavaScript code into smaller chunks and loading only the necessary chunks when they are required.

'React.Fragment' helps keep the DOM structure clean and avoids unnecessary wrappers."
},
{
  "id": 81,
  "question": "Explain the purpose of the 'useLayoutEffect' hook in React.",
  "answer": "The 'useLayoutEffect' hook in React is similar to 'useEffect', but it fires synchronously after all DOM mutations. It is often used for scenarios where measurements or manipulations of the DOM are needed before the browser repaints. While similar to 'useEffect', 'useLayoutEffect' can be more suitable for situations where synchronous execution is critical."

},
{
  "id": 84,
  "question": "What are the key differences between controlled and uncontrolled components in React forms?",
  "answer": "Controlled components in React forms are tied to the component's state, and their value is controlled by React. Changes to the value are handled through state, making them predictable. Uncontrolled components, on the other hand, store their own state internally, and React does not control their value. Uncontrolled components are often used when integrating with non-React code or for handling form inputs with dynamic values."
},
{
  "id": 85,
  "question": "Explain the concept of React forward refs and its use cases.",
  "answer": "React forward refs allow a parent component to access the ref of a child component. It is useful when you need to imperatively interact with a child component, such as focusing on an input or triggering a method. 'React.forwardRef' is a higher-order component that enables this behavior. It is often used in combination with the 'useImperativeHandle' hook to customize the values exposed through the ref."
},
{
  "id": 86,
  "question": "What is the purpose of the 'useImperativeHandle' hook in React?",
  "answer": "The 'useImperativeHandle' hook in React is used to customize the instance value that is exposed when using 'React.forwardRef'. It allows a parent component to interact with the child component's instance, controlling what values are exposed through the ref. 'useImperativeHandle' is useful for cases where a parent needs to interact with specific methods or properties of a child component."
},
{
  "id": 87,
  "question": "Explain the concept of React suspense and how it can be used.",
  "answer": "React suspense is a feature that allows components to wait for something before rendering. It is particularly useful for handling asynchronous operations such as data fetching.

},
{
  "id": 93,
  "question": "Explain the purpose of the 'useEffect' hook dependency array in React.",
  "answer": "The 'useEffect' hook dependency array is used to specify the dependencies for the 'useEffect' hook. When the values in the dependency array change between renders, the 'useEffect' callback is re-executed. Omitting the dependency array or leaving it empty causes the effect to run after every render. Correctly specifying dependencies is crucial to avoid unintended side effects and ensure proper cleanup in 'useEffect'."
